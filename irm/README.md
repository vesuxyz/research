# Analysis of historical rates

## Getting started

Navigate to the project's root folder
```bash
cd ./irm
```

If not already done, create a local python environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the local pyhton environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the python packages in the local python environment
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your environment is now ready to run the analysis. 

You can do that through vscode's interactive window or directly from the terminal
```bash
python3 historical_rates.py
```
